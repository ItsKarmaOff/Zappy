## Description üìù

The **Zappy** is a project carried out by **groups of 6** (see [Contributors](https://github.com/toro-nicolas/Jetpack/blob/main/README.md#contributors-)), during our **2nd year** in [**EPITECH**](https://www.epitech.eu/) Grand Ecole program.  
Its purpose is to create a network game where several teams confront each other on a tile map containing resources.  
The project involves developing a server in [**C**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), a graphical client in [**C++**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and an AI client with no language constraints.  

The game is set on a world called Trantor, which is a flat, tile-based map where players can move around, collect resources, and perform rituals to elevate their status.  
The winning team is the first one to have at least six players reach the maximum elevation level.  

Key features of the project include:  
- **Server**: Manages the game world, handles client connections, and enforces game rules.  
- **Graphical Client**: Provides a visual representation of the game world and actions.  
- **AI Client**: Autonomous clients that control players and make decisions based on the game state.  

For more information, please see the project specifications [here](resources/B-YEP-400_zappy.pdf) and [here](resources/B-YEP-400_zappy_GUI_protocol.pdf).

## Organisation üì¶

Each task must be written in an issue of the **Github Project**.  
An issue should be as detailed as possible, with all fields filled in: type, priority, labels, etc.  

It is strictly **forbidden to push directly on the "main" branch**.  
All commits must be made on the "dev" branch or on a sub-branch of "dev".  
Try to push as little as possible on "dev", and prioritize associated branches (use the "gui" branch to push commits associated with the GUI).  
The main branches deriving from "dev" are: "ai", "gui", "server", "unit-tests" and "website".  
Branch names must be in kebab-case.  
You should prioritize making sub-branches of "dev" sub-branches, for example: "gui-end-scenes".  
Once the branch has been completed, it should be merged into "gui", then "gui" into "dev", then "dev" into "main" and all sub-branches of "dev".  

The commits must follow this [**policy**](docs/COMMITS_POLICY.md).  
Before pushing a commit, the coding style, compilation and unit tests must be verified.  
If the conditions are not met, we'll be notified by github actions!
